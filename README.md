# How doest it work
This system allows you to know if you will have enough fuel in stock to reach your destination by applying the following formula: a-bx

where - a = Your fuel rate at the time of this calculation
      - b = The remaining flight time in seconds
      - c = Your current fuel rate (cruising altitude)

If you get a negative number on exit, this means that you will be short of that number of kg of fuel.
Otherwise, if you get a positive number, it will show the rate you have left on arrival.
